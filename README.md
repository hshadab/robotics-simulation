### Physics Simulation Realism (NEW)

RoboSim implements several features to ensure training data transfers well to real robots:

#### Inverse Kinematics-Based Motion
- **IK Pick-up Sequences** - Commands like "pick up the cube" use real inverse kinematics instead of hardcoded heuristics
- **Approach/Grasp/Lift Planning** - Each pick-up calculates three IK solutions (approach, grasp, lift) for smooth trajectories
- **Fallback Mode** - If IK fails (unreachable position), gracefully falls back to heuristic control
- **Single FK Source** - All gripper position calculations use the official SO-101 URDF parameters

#### Realistic Motor Dynamics
- **Velocity-Limited Motion** - Joints respect the STS3215 servo's 180°/s maximum velocity
- **Rise Time Simulation** - 150ms first-order response matching real servo behavior
- **S-Curve Easing** - Quintic S-curve (not cubic) for smooth acceleration/deceleration
- **Minimum Duration Enforcement** - Large movements automatically take longer (velocity-limited)

#### Why This Matters for Sim-to-Real
| Feature | Before | After | Real Robot |
|---------|--------|-------|------------|
| Joint velocity | Instant | 180°/s max | 180°/s max ✓ |
| Motion profile | Cubic ease | S-curve | S-curve ✓ |
| Pick-up planning | Heuristic | IK-based | IK-based ✓ |
| FK accuracy | Hardcoded | URDF-derived | URDF-derived ✓ |

Training data generated with these improvements will transfer better to real SO-101 hardware because the simulated trajectories match what the real servos can actually achieve.

## Technical Approach: Accurate Robot Models

This section documents the methodology used to create physically accurate robot simulations from real robot specifications.

### Step 1: Source Official Robot Data

For accurate simulations, start with official manufacturer data:

- **URDF files** - Unified Robot Description Format from the robot's official repository
- **STL meshes** - 3D geometry files linked in the URDF
- **Joint limits** - From URDF `<limit>` tags (converted from radians to degrees)
- **Gear ratios** - From manufacturer documentation (e.g., LeRobot docs for SO-101)

For SO-101, we use:
```
public/models/so101/
├── so101.urdf           # Official URDF from TheRobotStudio/SO-ARM100
└── meshes/
    ├── base_link.stl
    ├── shoulder_link.stl
    ├── upper_arm_link.stl
    ├── forearm_link.stl
    ├── wrist_link.stl
    ├── gripper_link.stl
    └── sts3215_*.stl    # Servo motor meshes
```

### Step 2: URDF Parsing with urdf-loader

Use the `urdf-loader` library to parse URDF and load STL meshes:

```typescript
import URDFLoader from 'urdf-loader';

const loader = new URDFLoader();
loader.packages = '/models/so101';  // Base path for mesh loading

// Custom STL loader with materials
loader.loadMeshCb = (path, manager, onComplete) => {
  const stlLoader = new STLLoader(manager);
  stlLoader.load(path, (geometry) => {
    const isServo = path.includes('sts3215');
    const material = isServo ? SERVO_MATERIAL : PRINTED_MATERIAL;
    const mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
    onComplete(mesh);
  });
};

loader.load('/models/so101/so101.urdf', (robot) => {
  // Robot is now a Three.js object with articulated joints
  robot.rotation.x = -Math.PI / 2;  // Z-up (URDF) to Y-up (Three.js)
});
```

### Step 3: Apply Realistic Materials

Differentiate between 3D-printed parts and servo motors:

```typescript
// 3D printed plastic (PLA/PETG)
const PRINTED_MATERIAL = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({
  color: '#F5F0E6',  // Off-white filament
  metalness: 0.0,
  roughness: 0.4,
});

// STS3215 servo motors
const SERVO_MATERIAL = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({
  color: '#1a1a1a',  // Black plastic housing
  metalness: 0.2,
  roughness: 0.3,
});
```

### Step 4: Joint Control via URDF

The urdf-loader provides `setJointValue()` for each joint:

```typescript
// Map UI names to URDF joint names
const JOINT_MAP = {
  base: 'shoulder_pan',
  shoulder: 'shoulder_lift',
  elbow: 'elbow_flex',
  wrist: 'wrist_flex',
  wristRoll: 'wrist_roll',
  gripper: 'gripper',
};

// Update joints (convert degrees to radians)
robot.joints[JOINT_MAP.shoulder].setJointValue((angle * Math.PI) / 180);
```

### Step 5: Self-Collision Prevention

Since URDF models are purely kinematic (no inter-link collision), we implement software constraints to prevent impossible poses:

```typescript
// src/lib/selfCollision.ts
export function preventSelfCollision(joints: JointState, robotId: string): JointState {
  if (robotId !== 'so-101') return joints;

  const corrected = { ...joints };

  // Shoulder+Elbow constraint: prevent arm folding through base
  // More shoulder tilt = less elbow can fold back
  if (corrected.shoulder > 40) {
    const minSum = -10;
    if (corrected.shoulder + corrected.elbow < minSum) {
      corrected.elbow = minSum - corrected.shoulder;
    }
  }

  return corrected;
}
```

This is applied in the Zustand store whenever joints are updated.

### Step 6: Physics Integration

Wrap the URDF model in Rapier physics:

```typescript
<RigidBody type="fixed" colliders={false}>
  <CuboidCollider args={[0.06, 0.04, 0.06]} position={[0, 0.04, 0]} />
  <primitive object={robot} />
</RigidBody>
```

The base is fixed, and the arm moves kinematically (driven by joint angles rather than physics forces).

### Benefits of This Approach

1. **Accuracy** - Real dimensions, joint limits, and gear ratios from manufacturer
2. **Visual fidelity** - Actual 3D geometry, not approximations
3. **Hardware compatibility** - Same joint names/limits as real hardware
4. **Maintainability** - Update by replacing URDF/STL files from upstream

## Architecture: Prompt-First Robot Control

RoboSim is designed with a **prompt-first** architecture where natural language is the primary interface for robot control, not an afterthought.

## Robot APIs

### SO-101 Robot Arm
```javascript
// Joint control (6-DOF)
robot.moveJoint('base', 45);      // Rotate base (shoulder_pan)
robot.moveJoint('shoulder', 30);  // Lift shoulder (shoulder_lift)
robot.moveJoint('elbow', -60);    // Bend elbow (elbow_flex)
robot.moveJoint('wrist', 20);     // Flex wrist (wrist_flex)
robot.moveJoint('wristRoll', 90); // Roll wrist (wrist_roll)

// Gripper control
robot.openGripper();              // Open gripper
robot.closeGripper();             // Close gripper
robot.setGripper(50);             // Set gripper to 50%

// Preset positions
robot.goHome();                   // Return to home position
```

### Keyboard Controls (SO-101)

Enable keyboard mode in the Advanced Controls panel:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| W/S | Shoulder up/down |
| A/D | Base rotate left/right |
| ↑/↓ | Elbow up/down |
| ←/→ | Wrist up/down |
| Q/E | Wrist roll left/right |
| Space | Open gripper |
| Shift | Close gripper |

### Gamepad Controls (SO-101)

| Control | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Left Stick X | Base rotation |
| Left Stick Y | Shoulder angle |
| Right Stick X | Wrist angle |
| Right Stick Y | Elbow angle |
| Left Bumper/Right Bumper | Wrist roll |
| Left Trigger | Close gripper |
| Right Trigger | Open gripper |

### Wheeled Robot (Coming Soon)
```javascript
robot.forward(150);               // Drive forward
robot.backward(100);              // Drive backward
robot.turnLeft(100);              // Turn left
robot.turnRight(100);             // Turn right
robot.stop();                     // Stop motors
```

### Drone (Coming Soon)
```javascript
drone.arm();                      // Arm motors
drone.takeoff(0.5);               // Take off to height (meters)
drone.land();                     // Land the drone
drone.setThrottle(60);            // Set throttle (0-100)
```

## Hardware Connection

### Web Serial (Real-time Mirror)

Connect directly to your SO-101 from the browser (Chrome/Edge required):

1. Click "Connect" in the Hardware Connection panel
2. Select your USB serial port (usually `/dev/ttyUSB0` or `COM3`)
3. Enable "Auto-sync" to mirror simulation to hardware in real-time

The default protocol sends servo PWM commands at configurable rates (1-60 Hz):
```
J0:1500,J1:1500,J2:1500,J3:1500,J4:1500,J5:1500
```

Configure your Arduino/ESP32 to parse this format and drive servos accordingly.

### Supported Baud Rates
- 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, 115200 (default), 250000, 500000, 1000000

## Hardware Export

### LeRobot Python (SO-101)

Export your simulation code to run on real SO-101 hardware using the HuggingFace LeRobot framework:

```python
from lerobot.common.robot_devices.motors.feetech import FeetechMotorsBus

# Generated code includes SO101Controller class
robot = SO101Controller(port="/dev/ttyUSB0")
robot.move_joint("shoulder", 45)
robot.go_home()
robot.disconnect()
```

Setup for real hardware:
```bash
pip install lerobot
pip install -e ".[feetech]"  # For STS3215 servo support
lerobot-find-port             # Discover serial port
lerobot-calibrate             # Calibrate arm positions
```

## Development Roadmap

RoboSim aims to be the fastest path from zero to trained robot policy. The following features are planned to address key pain points in robotics education and data collection.

### Phase 1: Onboarding Improvements (Quick Wins)
- [x] **First-run tutorial modal** - Detect new users and prompt interactive onboarding
- [x] **Batch episode recording** - "Record N episodes" button for efficient data collection
- [x] **Trajectory noise augmentation** - Add configurable noise to recorded episodes for diversity

### Phase 2: Data Generation Tools (Medium Effort)
- [x] **Parameterized task templates** - Configurable waypoints with randomizable parameters
- [x] **Visual randomization UI** - Lighting, texture, and color variation controls
- [x] **Dataset augmentation panel** - Multiply episodes with automated variations

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Major)
- [x] **Auto-episode generator** - One-click synthetic data generation (100+ episodes)
- [x] **Guided challenge system** - Interactive tutorials with position validation
- [x] **Direct HuggingFace upload** - Integrated Hub publishing without CLI

### Why These Features?

Based on research into robotics simulation pain points:

1. **Learning Curve**: Traditional tools like ROS/Gazebo require complex installation and version matching. RoboSim runs in any browser with zero setup.

2. **Data Collection Cost**: Imitation learning requires 50-200+ demonstration episodes, taking days of manual teleoperation. Automated generation can reduce this to minutes.

3. **Sim-to-Real Transfer**: Domain randomization (visual, sensor, trajectory) is essential for policies that work on real hardware.

See [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) for detailed implementation plans.
